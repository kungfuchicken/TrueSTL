# TrueSTL
## Background
TrueSTL was a creative coding educational outreach project initiated in 2012 and funded by a grant from the St. Louis Regional Arts Commission in 2013. It was intended to foster digital literacy by showing that writing "code" does not have to be daunting for the average person. It is no harder than telling your personal story to a friend. The project is written in [Processing](https://processing.org).
