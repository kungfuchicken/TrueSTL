  CHALLENGES
  
  sketch_TrueSTL:
  
  1.  We set the project's creator, date created and neigborhood in three separate lines.
  There is also a way to comment out these lines, and still have all the information set.
  Can you figure out how to do that?
  
  2.  Can you tell it to create the Actor "me" as an image?
  
  3.  Can you make the Actor "me" go to the left and return to a previous scene?
  
  Words:
  
  1.  Can you change the fill color and opacity  of the Words box and the fill color 
  and opacity of the text?  There is an easy way to do this, and some more advanced ways.  
  If you want to try the more advanced way, you might need to create some extra variables 
  in the Words class and maybe some of your own "setters and getters".
