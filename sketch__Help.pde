Welcome to Coding

Coding is the process of tranlating your ideas into something meaningful to a computer.  
When you code, you describe virtual objects to the computer.  You tell the computer 
all the characteristics of the virtual object and how to interact with that virtual object.  
If knowing how to use a computer is like knowing how to use a fork, then knowing 
how to code is like knowing how to cook.

Code may seem a little peculiar at first, but if you can write a recipe for a friend 
to make your favorite meal then you can probably learn to code.

Express Yourself with Code!

TrueSTL is a digital collage project designed to help ease you into the world of coding.  
With it, you can begin to tell the story of you in your neighborhood.  It offers suggestions 
throughout on how to customize the project to be your very own.

It is a fairly simple project, and has lots of explanation of every single bit of code right 
next to each line of code.  The project covers many of the basic skills of computer coding.  
It also offers friendly challenges you can try to solve to learn slightly more advanced coding.  

Read through the project and look for the CUSTOMIZE IT TIPS for specific examples of 
how to modify the base project to share your truth.

More Help

The TrueSTL project is written in a programming language and environment called Processing.  
Processing was specifically designed for creative people and projects.  Processing makes a lot 
of the details of coding easy, but it has all the power of a full computer programming language 
built in.  The processing website is great resource for more information, including:

a very comprehensive set of lessons:  http://processing.org/learning/
detailed reference pages:  http://processing.org/reference/
forums full of helpful people:  http://forum.processing.org/
a wiki full of user contributed documentation:  http://forum.processing.org/

You can also ask questions and share ideas in the TrueSTL forums:

Next Steps

TrueSTL is just a first step on what could be a long, exciting and rewarding journey 
if you want to keep learning how to code.  There are many more opportunities to learn coding.

Share your TrueSTL project:

To share your project, log in to the TrueSTL website and select the "Add My Project" menu item,
or you can just go directly to http://truestl.com/add/project  Make sure you give your 
project a Title, a short description, and indicate what neighborhood or municipality it is about.  
The date is automatically set to the current date, but you can change it to whatever date you 
actually finished it.  You can also mark on the map exactly where your TrueSTL project is about.
Then you can upload each file in your project folder individually, or you can upload a single 
.zip file of the entire project folder.
